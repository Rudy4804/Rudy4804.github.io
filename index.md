### CPSC 120


* Lab 5

   I enjoyed both parts of this lab, which is why itâ€™s one
   of my favorites. I liked how for part 1 we were able to
   create a code that would find area. I also really enjoyed
   having to test different functions to see which one works
   best. 
   


* Lab 8

   Both parts of this lab were fun and enjoyable for me. I
   thought part one was interesting because we were able to
   play around with different combinations. I thought part 2
   was fun because we got to work on code that would calculate
   averages for us. 


* Lab 9

   This lab was interesting because we were doing coding involving
   real world situations. For part 1, it was nice to continue working
   with averages, but using a situation like olympics score judging.
   I liked that for part 2, we got to code a schedule for philosophers.
