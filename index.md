### CPSC 120


* Lab 5

   I found doing this lab a little bit fun. I enjoyed both
   parts of this lab, which is why itâ€™s one of my favorites.
   I enjoyed working with the code to do the calculations for both parts.


* Lab 8

   Both parts of this lab were fun and enjoyable for me. I
   thought part one was interesting because we were able to
   mess around with different combinations. I thought part 2
   was fun being able to make a code that would calculate averages.


* Lab 9

   This lab was interesting because we were doing coding involving
   real world situations. For part 1, it was nice to continue working
   with averages, but using a situation like olympics score judging.
   I liked that for part 2, we got to code a schedule for philosophers.
